/*
  # Fix foreign key issues and improve error handling

  1. Changes
    - Add ON DELETE CASCADE to foreign key constraints
    - Ensure RLS policies allow proper access for anonymous users
    - Add additional error handling for database operations

  2. Security
    - Maintain security while allowing device-based authentication
    - Each user can still only modify their own data
